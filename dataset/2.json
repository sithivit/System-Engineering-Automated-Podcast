Well, I think it's going to take a while to build that a real civilization that I, the, the real, the threshold that really matters is for getting past the great filter is, Do We have enough resources on Mars, such that if the, if the spaceships from earth stop coming, you can survive.",
        "completion": "Yeah. So I can only be just missing one little thing. You'd be like, you're on a long sea voyage. And the only thing you're missing is vitamin C that's the luck. It was only a matter of time, you know? Yeah. And that's gonna be curtains. So you gotta have all the things necessary to sustain civilization on Mars. And the reason that those shifts from a stop coming could be world war three, or it could be due to a slow decline of civilization. So civilization here on earth could end with a bang or a whimper Or natural disasters. Yeah. Asteroid impacts. Yeah. The band category."

It was like a whole bunch of things happened in a row. And, and, you know, while like they could have taken any one of those things, they had like three things happen and no, Which is kind of amazing that crocodiles are still here. Yeah. Those fuckers, well, they're resilient. They all live on decayed meat and they love rotten meat.
