        "prompt": "Oh, Hello friends Welcome to the show. This episode of the podcast is brought to you by tushy. Tushy actually came up during this podcast organically. What tushy is, is it's a bidet attachment that you put on a regular toilet. It starts at only 79 bucks. It's a fantastic deal, and it sprays clean water right on your dirty parts. Now, if you've never used a bidet and you've just been wiping your butt with toilet paper, listen to me. If you got shit on any other part of your body, would you use a dry piece of paper to wipe it off and be satisfied? Of course you wouldn't. So why are you satisfied with your butt hole being barely clean?",
        "completion": "Not even clean, you're just smearing it. Listen to me, tushy is the way to go. It sprays water directly to your ass. It removes the poop completely so you're not sitting on bacteria that leads to nasty things like hemorrhoids and yeast infections and UTIs and itchy butt holes and skid marks. I use one. It's awesome. It's so much better than just toilet paper and it saves you a lot of money on toilet paper. And this is what came up during the podcast. You just need a tiny little bit to Pat your butt dry. You could use a towel if you want to and eliminate all your toilet paper. It cleans your butt. And it's better than wet wipes. Wet wipes are fucking terrible for you. They're terrible for the environment, and they cause anal fissures."

Like this is a real example of when something like this is absolutely necessary. Yes. I think another example, and then I'll come back to that, although I'm no expert in this topic, is why health insurance is tied to your employment in this country and Right. It makes no sense, right? I mean I don't want if, if if, if you lose your job and you can't get healthcare for a contagious disease, you're gonna be out and about spreading this contagious disease. Or why are we don't have sick leave policy for hourly workers?",
        "completion": "That also doesn't make sense. In other words, many hourly workers kept going to work when they were sick spreading the virus. This doesn't make any sense. We don't want that. So I think there's gonna be changes in how we couple insurance to employment and sick leave policies because having a contagious disease illustrates some of the demerits in the existing system. Now same goes with universal basic income. Now I'm not an expert in this area, but I, I think that the way the government handled the way it just pumped out money and I think there was also some corruption in like who got the money. I'm, I'm, I didn't track all this in detail. You may know this more than I do. I think we're gonna have to rethink that."
