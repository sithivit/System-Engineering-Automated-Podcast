I had no money and I wanted to get some cheap business shirts, so I went I went to the store and I had this Bargain Bin of shirts and I was just this huge array of white shirt.

So, yes, it's important that I let my wife dressed me. That's that's hilarious. It's also such a strange statement. We have a weird thing with pink. I don't understand why pink is such a polarizing collar with men. I've never had it explained to me correctly that this is one color that represents girls. There's no one color that represents my mean maybe blue but girls wear blue all the time and One thinks anything of it, but I agree."
