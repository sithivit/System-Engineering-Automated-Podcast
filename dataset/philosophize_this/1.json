Under one POSSIBLE way of setting things up, that itself would ALWAYS be open to improvements: but under one strategy there would BE no centralized federal AUTHORITY that organizes all these communities together. Again, the organization\u2026 would come from the bottom up. Communities could form unions with other communities insofar as both of them benefit from voluntarily agreeing to work together. These unions could form together into confederations through the same voluntary process\u2026with the same flexibility to back out should things not be working well."

If necessary there will be an election of temporary, highly supervised delegates to act as mouthpieces FOR the federated community\u2026 where once the decision has been carried out and put into practice in the world\u2026 that temporary office would dissolve, until a new one is needed for a NEW decision that needs to be made. Again the THINKING is that the power is ALWAYS in the hands of the people that are being impacted by the decisions."

IF what an anarchist is concerned with is hierarchical authority WHERE EVER it may exist in a society. IF we are entertaining the idea that we may be like slaves or other oppressed people of the past who have been indoctrinated to see the power structures that are dominating our life as NECESSARY for life to be able to function. And KNOWING that for the last several episodes we\u2019ve been talking about Foucault, and Deleuze and Byung Chul Han and Agamben and this contemporary analysis of WHERE power actually EXISTS in the world. Some anarchists may ask the question: are we maybe focusing a bit too much here on the government side of things?"

We have privatized tyrannies\u2026 that we call corporations\u2026 that control the materials that people build their life with. We have a media apparatus\u2026 that controls the ideas\u2026 that people build their worldview with. We have more brick and mortar institutions that control the norms and taboos we use to understand ourselves and each other. ALL of these\u2026are NOT things that the government oversees and controls. In fact the reality is that the government is often too weak to protect people AGAINST tyrannies like these\u2026 because a tyranny doesn\u2019t need to have the same checks and balances as a government often does. Corporations end up controlling the government, not the other way around. Media often dictates who even gets elected."

To him, just taking an inventory of where we\u2019re actually at\u2026the more REALISTIC, SHORT term goal is to USE the regulatory power of the state\u2026 to dismantle the sweeping authority of the private sector and its GRIP on people\u2019s lives. You know as imperfect as it may be\u2026to Chomsky, sometimes you need ONE authority in the short term\u2026 to help deal with another authority that\u2019s more urgent and problematic."

PLEASE\u2026for the sake of next episode being as good as possible for EVERYONE\u2026if you HAVE one of those questions\u2026find some way to get it to me.
