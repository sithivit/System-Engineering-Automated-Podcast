Thanks for contributing for the back catalog 179 episodes now, pretty exciting. And for 178 episodes\u2026 this show has been talking about the history of philosophical ideas that have GOTTEN us up to this point. And it\u2019s a GOOD thing we spent that long I think. I think to be able to understand the world you\u2019re living in it HELPS to understand the history that it emerged out of."

Hopefully there\u2019s at least SOMEBODY\u2026 out there that can RELATE to the way I used to feel: the THINKING was\u2026 who REALLY sits around and THINKS about unanswered questions in the philosophy of mind? How does consciousness arise? Are we free or do we just SEEM to be free? How does my mind causally RELATE to OBJECTS in the world?"

        "text": "Well CLEARLY not. CLEARLY there\u2019s ANOTHER way to be THINKING about these conversations going on in the philosophy of mind\u2026 and that is\u2026that EVERY FURTHER conversation that we have about ANYTHING that matters to us as people\u2026ultimately EMERGES OUT of the assumptions that we\u2019re MAKING about the nature of consciousness\u2026and then our understanding of what a human MIND is that emerges out of THAT."

EVEN THAT, is GROUNDED on us MAXIMIZING certain subjective, conscious experiences, and moving away from OTHERS. Any conversation about relationships\u2026RELATIONSHIPS you could make the case are just the details of how two or more CONSCIOUS people are interacting. POLITICS is just the STRATEGY of how CONSCIOUS beings try to get what they want in relation to OTHER conscious beings."

And I\u2019ll DO IT while offering up as MANY of these different THEORIES being DISCUSSED today AS I CAN\u2026so you can NOT ONLY be more self aware of where YOU fall in the discussion, but hopefully, you\u2019ll be able to understand other people positions better as well.\n\n \n\nNow let\u2019s get INTO it\u2026and if I\u2019ve convinced you that learning more about these conversations in the philosophy of mind is important\u2026one of the FIRST questions you gotta be ASKING as a modern person AFTER that, CERTAINLY a question I was asking years ago\u2026is if I want to know MORE about what consciousness IS\u2026WHY wouldn\u2019t I just study science, and the brain? Why are philosophers weighing in on this stuff at all?"

That if we just keep running these experiments, learning as much as we can about the physical, neuro-chemical makeup of the brain that\u2026 we\u2019ll eventually be able to understand EVERYTHING about subjective experience."

Which is to say that the WAY we conceptually organize things\u2026often times PRECEDES the scientist\u2026and it GIVES them the assumptions they have to use when doing THEIR work."

He describes matter in the physical world as having both primary and secondary qualities. He says objects have primary qualities\u2026those are things like size, shape, mass, density. But then they also have secondary qualities, things like color, texture, smell or taste. Now that is a way that philosophers chop up and CONCEPTUALLY analyze the world PRIOR TO any ACTUAL experiments that may be done by a scientist."

        "text": "In other words: some people in these discussions going on today THINK that it may BE\u2026 that the reason conversations about consciousness are so mysterious to us is because there is something WRONG about way we break down reality at the ROOT level of concepts. And that if only we shifted something AT that fundamental level, everything ELSE would start to make a lot more sense."

        "text": "This is why philosophers and scientists have to work TOGETHER on this stuff these days. Philosophers and scientists need each other. Philosophers rethink reality at a conceptual level. Scientists then run brilliant experiments to get to the actual empirical data. But while scientists can and often have to compartmentalize themselves into their specialized field\u2026philosophers can take a step back, and they have the LUXURY of looking at all the discoveries in psychology and linguistics and neuroscience and they can try to come up with a theory as to how all these different fields link together. Science tells you what the world IS\u2026philosophy tells you how to interpret it. Put another way: no matter how brilliant of a neuroscientist you may be\u2026you will still ALWAYS have to be doing philosophy to be able to INTERPRET the data that you\u2019re gathering."

We MAY NOT KNOW what consciousness is\u2026but we DO KNOW what we\u2019re talking about\u2026we\u2019re talking about a CERTAIN kind of SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE that we ALL seem to have\u2026that is DISTINCT from OTHER things going on in your mind right now\u2026that are usually presumed to be going on at a LOWER level, of experience, whatever THAT means."

They\u2019ve obviously identified the specific PARTS of the BRAIN that deal with memory, the ones that deal with perceptions, the ones that deal with ATTENTION\u2026and ALL of that\u2019s FANTASTIC\u2026but there STILL seems to be something ELSE to our conscious experiences of reality\u2026 that lies OUTSIDE of this access consciousness\u2026and it SEEMS to be something that neuroscience hasn\u2019t quite figured out yet."

For example: The way that scientists and philosophers will often TALK about it in these conversations\u2026they\u2019ll ask what does it FEEL like\u2026to SEE the REDNESS of an apple. That\u2019s one that these people use a lot. Can you describe that? Picture trying to describe what it\u2019s LIKE to see the color red\u2026 to someone that\u2019s never seen color before.

And then in ANOTHER sense\u2026IF you wanted to try to explain it PURELY in scientific terms\u2026you know if you wanted to try to break it down and understand ALL the COMPONENTS of what\u2019s going at the neuro-chemical level and then look at the atoms that make up the apple for example\u2026well the atoms that make up the APPLE\u2026 are not red\u2026it has SOMETHING to do with the way your conscious experience FILTERS reality that makes it look red to you\u2026and THEN it\u2019s a TOTALLY different thing, ENTIRELY BEYOND whatever mental filtration system you got going on\u2026 to THEN have a subjective EXPERIENCE of REDNESS ON TOP OF THAT\u2026where part of it\u2026is that there\u2019s this unified stream of YOU, being a continuous SELF, with continuity to time, continuity to your identity.

The implication being when you SAY that is that to some philosophers: no matter how advanced neuroscience ever gets\u2026it will NEVER be able to find the neural correlates of consciousness they say, or it will never be able to find the specific states of the brain that give rise to these subjective experiences."

It could be that consciousness is an illusion\u2026that it only SEEMS to us like there\u2019s this command center up in our heads where we exist, because it\u2019s biologically useful for it to be there.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s often called the hard problem of consciousness. A term coined by a guy named David Chalmers back in 1995, when he wrote one of the books basically everyone will be referencing in modern conversations about consciousness it\u2019s called The Conscious Mind."

That assumption CHANGES the way that you see yourself. It CHANGES the way that you see others.

Or that consciousness, is something non-local, part of some larger NETWORK of consciousness that EXISTS somewhere. In other words: the PHILOSOPHY you choose can make CERTAIN THINGS seem PLAUSIBLE that we REALLY have no reason to assume\u2026and somebody TOO desperate to SOLVE the hard problem of consciousness in today\u2019s world that uses Cartesian Dualism to DO so\u2026 might be inviting a LOT of stuff into what's REASONABLE down the line that they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re inviting."

The zombie HAS no \u201cphenomenal feel\u201d he says, there are no qualia in the mind of this zombie\u2026in other words\u2026 it doesn\u2019t FEEL like anything, to BE this zombie."

Or the conscious experience of something like ChatGPT in the realm of artificial intelligence. In BOTH of THOSE cases the philosophical zombie of Chalmers starts to make a lot more sense\u2026because IF we DON\u2019T have an answer to the question of WHEN the type of conscious experience that WE have ARISES\u2026then we DON\u2019T KNOW at what point animals or AI need to be GIVEN certain moral protections."
