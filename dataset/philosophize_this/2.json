Ground\u2019s covered in frost and black ice, it\u2019s pitch black outside\u2026 I\u2019M sliding around everywhere trying to get a morning walk in like a COMPLETE genius here. And my friend who doesn\u2019t read any philosophy turns to me as we\u2019re doing this and he says, so this GUY you\u2019re talking about\u2026Giorgio Agamben\u2026what\u2019s HIS whole deal, you got any idea of what you\u2019re gonna be saying yet? And right when he asks me im walking downhill and I hit a giant patch of black ice\u2026and im just sliding downhill\u2026and as I\u2019m Tokyo drifting down the sidewalk of my neighborhood my head\u2019s in another place and I say back to him well look one of the FIRST things you gotta know about him is that he\u2019s not a big fan of human rights. That\u2019s what I led with."

It was MY response when I first heard about these ideas years ago. And it can be so mysterious at first: why would a philosopher like Giorgio Agamben be SO CRITICAL of something with such good intentions behind it? Something that really at bottom is just trying to protect the dignity and freedom of people going through dangerous times."

I\u2019m talking about Simone Weil. One of my personal FAVORITE philosophers, a woman Giorgio Agamben did a dissertation on when he was in school, a woman he has a tremendous amount of respect for, and someone it\u2019s NOT CRAZY TO IMAGINE\u2026may have INFLUENCED this AREA in his thinking."

One of the PROBLEMS she says is that human rights fundamentally are always trying to reduce humanity\u2026 down into the language of legal or commercial discourse. But that\u2019s impossible she thought."

The reason it\u2019s wrong is because you\u2019re robbing some piece of what it is that makes her a person. You\u2019re stealing her humanity in a way. Her POINT is: there\u2019s a sense in which trying to DEFINE these sorts of things in LEGAL TERMS\u2026ends up MISSING something that\u2019s important about the whole process of protecting human dignity and freedom."

I\u2019ll try to give a balanced perspective here: how about the United States invading Iraq in 2003. There were a lot of reasons that were given for WHY we should be invading a country that didn\u2019t attack us. Weapons of mass destruction was a reason given for sure. But another MAIN REASON that was GIVEN was that we are the LEADERSHIP of the world\u2026and we have to spread DEMOCRACY and FREEDOM to that entire region. That we have a moral obligation to SAVE these people who are being tortured under the regime of Saddam Hussein. In other words: it was a humanitarian effort! Women are being treated horribly. Apostates are being murdered. We were TOLD in the United States on our TVs that they didn\u2019t even have a SINGLE KFC in ALL of Baghdad. It had gone too far. We HAD to do something about it."

It was that we CARE too much about the people.

But one of the primary ones was that ethnic Russians, Russian speaking people who mostly IDENTIFY as Russian are VICTIMS of terrible human RIGHTS violations going on in Ukraine. WE gotta go SAVE em!

Two concepts in Aristotle\u2019s work\u2026 that are OFTEN seen as connected together\u2026the concepts of Zoe and Bios. One simple way of thinking of these two things is that Zoe is the part of human life that we sometimes call the PRIVATE realm\u2026and Bios is what we often call the PUBLIC realm. Zoe is the ability for someone to live privately, at home, with autonomy over their own biological, natural life.

He thought that whenever you have a constitution\u2026and you have checks and balances built into your political system so that no one president can ever change anything too much\u2026that SOUNDS great and all. But IN PRACTICE he says\u2026whenever something sufficiently BAD ever goes down in the world\u2026ALL that actually happens is the people in power declare a state of emergency\u2026and then they get extra-constitutional power to be able to do whatever they want anyway.

        "text": "Regardless of which of these examples you agree with or don\u2019t\u2026Agamben would say it\u2019s important for us to continuously look at the events that are going on in the world\u2026 the people that are being essentially kept in prisons or concentration camps without having ever been convicted of a crime and NO hope of getting OUT of it\u2026he\u2019d say it is crucial\u2026for us to remain CAUTIOUS of this political strategy being accepted as just something that\u2019s completely normal. How many people are being locked in cages both literally and metaphorically\u2026simply because someone in power, somewhere decided to label them as associated with an enemy group?"

        "text": "Another interesting criticism Giorgio Agamben has of modern western society is that if you pay attention to the way that MANY of the institutions are designed\u2026the whole thing\u2026 SEEMS to be organized in a way that doesn\u2019t really value potential. And he means potential in a very general sense you know you can imagine a seed\u2026and in actuality it is just a seed. But it ALSO ABSOLUTELY carries with it a sort of latent POTENTIAL to become something like a fully formed plant. There\u2019s a relationship between potentiality and actuality and modern society, it seems, doesn\u2019t really value potential in a meaningful way. In fact it seems to actively want to SQUASH potential. Some examples of what he means:"

Teachers don\u2019t look at each and every student, identify their strengths, see their potential as an individual and what they may be able to go on to do to impact society in the greatest way possible, and then encourage that potential. No, what WE do\u2026is we give kids a standardized test at the end of the year to measure how many facts they\u2019ve memorized. And what happens in practice is that teachers\u2026 will often teach the children JUST so they can do well on that standardized test where the numbers matter. Their potential as a human being\u2026 isn\u2019t even really something that crosses their minds."

        "text": "But then that kid graduates from school and ends up going into the work force. Corporations are ANOTHER example of a place in modern society where they\u2019re not looking at each employee and considering what they have the potential to grow into, maybe even revolutionize the company someday. No, companies focus\u2026 on productivity, profit, they give employees very clear tasks with very clear deliverables that they have to accomplish every day."

        "text": "Another example can be found in prisons. When someone commits a crime\u2026WE focus a lot on the punishment side of things\u2026we focus on them doing the hard time so they can pay their debt to society. In other words: there\u2019s no focus on the prisoners as individuals with potential, where their time in prison could be spent becoming something that could benefit society the most when they get out. We focus on punitive measures."

        "text": "Anyway POINT is: potential to Agamben is this MASSIVELY important thing if we EVER want to visualize society in a way that makes the world a better place\u2026and yet it can SEEM sometimes like entire institutions don\u2019t want to consider alternative, potential realities at all. Potential, to Agamben, although it can SEEM like such a simple thing, potential actually has the power to BE something that people can be UNITED under, a common banner that\u2019s trying to bring about a better world where the typical TRIBAL dividing lines between people aren\u2019t as pronounced."

Or you don't LOOK the right way. Or because you\u2019re not the right gender. Or because we disagree about some OTHER political issue. No EVERYBODY regardless of what immutable characteristics they were born with were welcome as long as they believed in the vision of a potential world where things were better. Well if a subcommunity like that can be formed on the basis of encouraging potential\u2026what if an entire COMMUNITY or society could be formed on that basis?"

At WORST this is going to show you that anarchist\u2026is not just a phase you go through in college because you got a parking ticket and now you hate the government. There\u2019s actually brilliant people dedicating their lives to try to answer these questions. As always if you want more Agamben or ANY thinker we\u2019ve been discussing lately you know what to do. Just post a comment that says MORE Agamben or MORE Nussbaum. I truly am a spaniel at thy gate.
